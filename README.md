## Development

### Running tests

To run the full test suite, you need MongoDB running without authorisation on port 27017. To start such Mongo instance, check comments in `docker-compose.yaml` file and run Mongo according to them.

Command to run full test suite would be:

```shell
ENABLE_MONGO_TESTS=true go test ./...
```
